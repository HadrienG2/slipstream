# Impatient

Trying to create a safe SIMD API that would be usable by masses, but still
allowed reasonably fast results and offer things like runtime CPU detection.

See the [blog post](https://vorner.github.io/2020/05/08/simd-library-plans.html)
for some initial ideas.

Note that it is currently *very experimental* and unfinished.
